- The `Runnable` interface in Java is a functional interface that represents a task that can be executed concurrently by a thread. 
- It contains a single abstract method called `run()`, which does not take any arguments and does not return a value. 
- When a class implements the `Runnable` interface, it must provide an implementation for the `run()` method.

Here's the signature of the `Runnable` interface:

```Java
public interface Runnable {
    void run();
}
```

- The `run()` method contains the code that constitutes the task to be executed. When a class implements `Runnable`, it can be instantiated as a thread and started using the [[Thread Class]] or a [[Executor Service]] service, allowing the `run()` method to be executed concurrently in a separate thread.

Here's an example of implementing the `Runnable` interface:

```Java
class MyRunnableTask implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        // Code to be executed concurrently
        System.out.println("Task is running in a separate thread.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an instance of the class that implements Runnable
        Runnable myRunnable = new MyRunnableTask();

        // Create a Thread with the Runnable instance
        Thread thread = new Thread(myRunnable);

        // Start the thread, which will execute the run() method concurrently
        thread.start();
    }
}
```

- In this example, the `MyRunnableTask` class implements the `Runnable` interface and provides an implementation for the `run()` method. 
- An instance of `MyRunnableTask` is then passed to a `Thread` object, and the `start()` method is called on the thread to execute the `run()` method concurrently in a separate thread of execution.

- 80/20 Pareto law: 80% of functionality will account for 20% of usage
- Principle of Least Effort: Make frequent things easy and unlikely things harder
- Principle of Least Astonishment: The design should match the user's experience, expectations and mental models
- Aesthetic usability effect: Things that look better perform better in usability tests
- Apparent Vs Inherent Usability: Interface designers should strive not only to improve inherent usability but also brush up the apparent usability or the aesthetic aspect of the interface
- Modes: allow different behaviours from same interface features (e.g: Caps Lock, Num Lock)
- Feedback: every user action needs the interface to react so that the user knows the action is complete
- Equal opportunity: there should be mo difference between input and output values
- Fitts's Law: time taken to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target
- Hick's Law: Time taken to reach a decision goes up as number of choices increases
- Signal to noise ration: eliminate the unnecessary

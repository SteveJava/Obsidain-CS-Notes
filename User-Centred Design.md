- Interaction Design: understanding the dynamics of how we interact with computing devices
- Problem: most people who are good at programming have terrible instincts for what users actually want.
- Human Computer Interaction is interdisciplinary, meaning it draw upon other disciplines such as social science, philosophy, psychology, etc. 

## Goals

At a high level, user interaction designers seek to build applications that are;
- learnable
- effective to use
- enjoyable to use

At the second order, we have different goals, from getting lots of likes and user retention to perhaps social good goals like improving how people use masks or understand their health

How do we become good designers?
- Need to follow written and unwritten design principles
- Standards and guidelines that help us to predict whether someone will like a particular interface 

## 10 Usability Heuristics

1. Visibility of system status
	- system should always keep users informed on what is going on
2. Match between system and real world
	- System should speak user's language and follow real world conventions
3. User control and freedom
	- Support undo and redo. User should have an "emergency exit" to escape unwanted state
4. Consistency and Standards
	- Users shouldn't have to worry whether different things mean the same thing
5. Error prevention
	- Design that prevents errors is better than error messages
6. Recognition rather than recall
	- Users shouldn't have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another
7. Flexibility and ease of use
	- Allow users to tailor different frequent actions
8. Aesthetic and Minimalist design
	- Dialogues should not contain irrelevant information
9. Help users recognise, diagnose and recover from errors
	- Error messages should be expressed in plain language
10. Help and documentation
	- Provide help and documentation that is easy to search and focuses on user tasks

## The Design Cycle

- User-centred design starts and ends with real users

Design -> Prototype -> Evaluate

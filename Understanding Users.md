## Who are your participants?

- Consider personas (Parents, teachers, Children)
- Consider context (Where and when they will use the app?)
- What can you get access to?

## What do you need to test?

- Define test activities:
	- What are the tasks? Observe and Test, do not guess

## What is your question?

- Would yo use this app?
- Are buttons or swipe actions more natural for children using the app?
- Is this app more "usable" than alternative app X?

## A Rough Approach

1. Observation
2. Enquiry
3. Analysis
4. Prototype
5. Rinse and Repeat

## Focus the study

 - Who are we interested in? What is the profile (age, skills, etc.)of our users?
 - What is the domain? College students? Healthcare?
 - Are there any technology constraints?
 - What broad user-goals are we keen to support?

## Recruiting Participants

- Participant bias: they won't necessarily give you their honest opinion, wanting you to feel good about what you've developed
- Homogeneity: The people around you tend to like you and not give good feedback

## Find some users

- It is not easy to 1) find users and 2) find users that will give useful information 

## Quantitative Measurements 

- experiments to determine behaviour in controlled settings
- What are your metrics? Time taken, errors, data consumed, income generated, etc.
- What is your setting? Are there any confounding variables?
- Do you have statistical significance?

## Quantitative data 

### Logging

- Instrument software to record interactions
	- Key presses
	- Mouse movements 
	- Screen touches/clicks
	- Reading time
	- Eye tracking...
- Logs of interactions are time stamped
- Useful for Web studies, testing layouts, understanding reaction time, etc.

### Surveys

- **Numeric responses**: How many times product was purchased
- **Likert scale responses**: Odd allow neutrality, Even forces choice

What makes good survey questions?
- Simple, specific, individual, exhaustive, optional, neutral and balanced

**A/B test example: Button Color**

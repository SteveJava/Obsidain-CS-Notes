- Humans play a significant role in how and whether computing systems will actually work
- Human Computer Interaction (HCI) draws on many disciplines including cognitive psychology, anthropology, ergonomics and computer science
- HCI also has many sub-branches like UX

## Shneiderman Golden Rules of Design

1. Strive for consistency
	- Consistent sequences of actions should be required in similar situations

2. Cater to universal usability
	- Recognise the needs of diverse users. 
	- Provide features for different types of users such as explanations for novices, features for experts such as shortcuts and faster pacing, etc.

3. Offer informative feedback
	- For every user-action, there should be an interface feedback. If the feedback is frequent, have modest responses. 
	- If the feedback is infrequent, responses should be more substantial

4. Design dialogs to yield closure
	- Sequences of actions should be organised into groups with a beginning, middle, and end
	- Informative feedback after completion of a group of tasks gives users a sense of accomplishment

5. Prevent errors
	- Design the interface such that users cannot make serious errors
	- The interface should offer simple, constructive, and specific instructions for recovery
	- Erroneous actions should leave the interface state unchanged, or the interface should give instructions about restoring the state

6. Permit easy reversal of actions
	- As much as possible, actions should be reversible

7. Keep users in control
	- Experienced users strongly desire the sense that they are in control of the interface and that the interface responds to their actions

8. Reduce short-term memory load
	- Avoid interfaces in which users must remember information from one display and then use that information from one display to another

## Using Design Principles

- **Goal**: provide designers with information and insights about the (potential) impact of their designs
- **Trade-offs**: the more general a rule, the more chance it conflicts with another rule

### Standards

> Guidelines are vague; need to know theoretical underpinning

- Usually set by an international committee

Android Standards Example:
- Use the platform's built in widgets and layouts whenever possible; these views provide accessibility support by default
- Use the options menu as an alternative to touchscreen tasks
- Make sure the back button correctly moves the user one logical step back

### Guidelines

> Standards can be very specific

- Tend to be generalisations - the more general, the earlier they should be in the design process
- Can range from users must initiate all dialogs (Android) to use white space between long groups of menu controls

Android Guidelines Example:
- Place most frequent used operations first
- Don't put commands only in a Context Menu
- First command in a Context Menu should be the select command

### Standards vs Guidelines
| Standards              |     | Guidelines                  |
| ---------------------- | --- | --------------------------- |
| Higher Authority       |     | Lower Authority             |
| Little overlap         |     | Conflicts/overlap/trade-off |
| Limited application    |     | Less focused                |
| Minimal Interpretation |     | Interpretation required     |

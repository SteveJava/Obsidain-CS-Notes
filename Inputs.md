## Direct Manipulation

- Fast and incremental allows fro continuous representation
- Incremental affords learning - initiating an action that's undoable allows people to learn quickly what that action will achieve
- The immediate visual impact allows people to immediately know the effects of their action, making it seem like they are interacting with a real object, not just a virtual representation
- Undoable actions allows people to go back and forth with the manipulation
